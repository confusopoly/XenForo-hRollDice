## Information

This Dice Manager from Hoffi is an awesome Tool, which is used to roll Dice.

In the AdminCP the Admin can add and edit dice, rules and wiresets (RPG Systems like D&D) with easy and complex rules. All can be ex- and imported.

You can do much more, than roll a simmple d10 inside a post. You can roll your attack roll with your skill and the system will tell you, it your roll was a success.

Inside your post the rolls are displayed and can be collapsed to save space.

I developed this addon very integrated into the XenForo System, so you can use Alerts, Moderation log, Admin Search, statistics and more.

Please give me Feedback at XenDACH.de or XenForo.com

## Installation

It's really easy. Simple du this few steps:

1.  Upload all files from the upload directory to the corresponding directory on your server.
2.  Install the XML AddOn File.
3.  After that follow the next steps in this instructions for your first Setup.

<div id="options"></div>
## Settings

The Basic Settings are some few self explaining settings.

At the Bottom is a field for a system Key. If you save the settings with activated "fetch key" option, the system will contact my server and send back a key. Only the URL, the AddOn and the AddOn Version will be transferred to my server.

The key is only an information for me, the addon will ever work without a license key with all options. If you don't want to fetch a key, so don't so it and enjoy the AddOn without.

If you get e key once, at every update the new Version will be promoted to my. But I have only the actual Information. I store no history or any personal data.

## Usergroups

There are three new rights for usergroups:

*   Can roll dice
*   Can see rolled dice
*   can delte every dice roll (moderative rights)

There is no right, that a user can delete own rolls, to prevent misbehaviour.

<div id="rules"></div>
## Dice

First, you mus create dice. In theimport folder you can import a pre-Set of dice. You must use all three import files from one language to get the system to work.

You can edit every attribute of the die after the import, but not the tag like d6.

If you want to change the icon of an image, upload your own. You can use individual Images per Style.

<div id="dice"></div>
## Rules

Import the rules from the same language as the dice. You can add your own rules.

The rules define, if a roll is won or not.

<div id="wiresets"></div>
## Wireframes

After you imported dice and rules, you can import the wireframes in the same language. Wireframes are the Dice System, like World of Darkness or Dungeons and Dragons.

Just take a look at the wireframes, create your own and share them. There is an export function.

## Forums

Now its time, to tell your fourms, to acced dice rolls. Edit the Node and you see a new tab with additions informations for the dice settings.

If you have installed many wireframes, you can select individual wireframes that can be rolled per forum.
